    "\n",
    "    * CAPM equation shows the relation between expected return and risk\n",

    "    - Individual Behavior\n",
    "        - Investors are rational, mean-variance optimizers\n",
    "        - Their common planning horizon is a single period\n",
    "        - Investors all use identical input lists, an assumption often termed homogenous expectations; all relevant information is publically available\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Market Structure\n",
    "        - All assets are publicaly held and trade on public exchanges\n",
    "        - Investors can borrow or lend at a common risk-free rate, and they can take short positions on traded securities\n",
    "        - No Taxes, nor transaction costs\n"

    "    - $b$ = plowback or retention rate (b = 1-dividend payout ratio)\n",
